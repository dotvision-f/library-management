A Library Management System

• Define the classes: Start by defining the classes you'll need for the project,
such as Book, Member, Loan, and Library. Each class should have
appropriate attributes and methods.

• Implement the functionality: Implement the methods for each class to
provide the necessary functionality for the Library Management System.
For example, the Library class might have methods to add books, check out
books, return books, and search for books.

• Store data: Decide how to store the data for the Library Management
System. You could use a file, a database, or any other persistent storage
mechanism.

• Input/Output: Implement input/output (I/O) mechanisms to allow users to

interact with the Library Management System. You might use a command-
line interface, a graphical user interface (GUI), or both.

• Test and refine: Thoroughly test the system to ensure that it meets your
requirements and to identify and fix any bugs.

• Finalize the project: Document your code, write a report explaining your
design choices and testing results, and submit the project for review.
